Student : Louise LAM (21980795) M2BI

# Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a functional version of my short-term AIAO project running on your local machine. Please follow the instructions below for an optimal experience.

The goal of this project was to resolve two classification problems using neural networks:
1. Classification of digits from images using the MNIST dataset.
2. Classification of subcellular localizations from protein sequences using the MultiLoc dataset.

ðŸ’¡ If you do not want to install/run it locally on your machine, you can go to the Google Colab section and click on the links below.

# Installation (UNIX console)
1. Clone the project repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Louise-coder/aiao-little-project.git
    ```

2. Create the conda environment from the environment.yml file using the command:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

# Usage
1. Activate the conda environment using the command:
    ```bash
    conda activate aiao-env
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks using the commands:
    ```bash
    jupyter LAM_mnist.ipynb
    jupyter LAM_localization.ipynb
    ```

# Google Colab
